# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-based-on-CNN
Developed a facial emotion recognition model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with VGGNet.
Trained the model with the FER2013 dataset using the Nesterov momentum-based SGD method and implemented a learning rate monitor to mitigate overfitting. 
The identification accuracy reaches 65%.
